SimpleQuote.py takes in user information including their name, phone number, and address and updates it accordingly. 
SimpleQuote.py outputs the user's phone number in a specific format {XXX} XXX-XXXX and updates the user's address using a python file called addressUpdate.py
in the parent folder which I also wrote. addressUpdate.py takes a user's address as an input and outputs the correctly formatted/corrected address using Google's 
Maps API.
