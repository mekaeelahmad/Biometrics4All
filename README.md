simpleQuotes.py takes in customer information including their business name, first/last name, phone number, and address and updates it accordingly. 
simpleQuotes.py outputs the given information in a specific format whilst fixes incorrect inputs. For example, it outputs the customer's number in the format 
"(XXX) XXX-XXXX" and updates the user's address using a python file called addressUpdate.py in the parent folder which I also wrote. 
addressUpdate.py takes a user's address as an input and outputs the correctly formatted/corrected address using Google's Maps API. 

googleLocations.py documentation is in GoogleLocationsDocumentation.docx.
